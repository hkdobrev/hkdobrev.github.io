    <p>
      I gave the closing talk at
      <a href="https://www.openfest.org/2016/en/schedule/">OpenFest 2016</a>.
      It was about why and how to contribute to open-source software.
      I talked about the problem of bringing more contributors to open-source,
      why people should contribute and how it would benefit them.
      Gave some tips on how to start contributing and do also do
      open-source at work.
